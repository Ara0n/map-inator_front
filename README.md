# map-inator

A new map tool for Khorvaire.

## description

The plan for this is to be a software written in React, with Leaflet for the map managment and neo4j/cypher for the graphs of cities and mediums of transportation.

You will be able to add cities on the map with relevent informations such as the presence of a teleportation circle and/or a tree big enough for transport via plants. Once you have your cities placed you will be able to add mediums of transports inbetween them such as roads, rails and water with a distance specified.

With all the cities and mediums placed you will be able to query for the possible itineraries between a starting and ending city and it will give you relevent informations such as travel time and cost for the different mediums possible. In a second time I plan on making it a travel planner where it will give you the possibility to get the cheapest travel, the fastest travel combining mediums, travels with a maximum budget, etc...

_**TODO:** better README_
